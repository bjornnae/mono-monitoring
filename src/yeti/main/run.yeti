/* 
This is the part of the program which is responsible for looping the change and action process.
The configuration file mono.properties holds a property named mono.pollwait.seconds. This polling intervall will decide how often the monitoring Agent is run. If you want an agent that quickly discovers new events (but eats system resources) you set this value low (e.g. 0.10). If you have a system where time to detection is less critical, set this value to 10 or 60.
